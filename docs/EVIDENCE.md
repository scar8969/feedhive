## Live route walk

The application was imported through `wsgi.py` and each GET path declared in `openapi/` was requested once through the Werkzeug test client.

| Status | Path | Bytes | Content-Type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 200 | `/api/feeds` | 13 | application/json |
| 200 | `/api/entries` | 15 | application/json |
| 200 | `/api/search` | 15 | application/json |

3 paths walked, 0 of them raised or answered 5xx.

## What this file does not prove

- It is not a load test: every request is a single uncached call from one process.
- A green suite is not a coverage claim; `pytest --cov` reports the number the README quotes.
- The route walk exercises GET paths only; mutating routes are covered by the suite.
